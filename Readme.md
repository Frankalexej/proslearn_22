# Proslearn

Welcome to the Proslearn project!

## Overview

Proslearn is a project from CompLDL at HKU. It aims to investigate the effect of length of exposure to non-full range sounds (i.e. in utero condition) to the learning of different aspects of phonetic and phonological learning, of which the first step is prosody learning. 

## Features

- **Prosodic Analysis**: Tools for analyzing intonation, stress, and rhythm in speech.

- **Customizable Workflows**: Flexible configurations to suit various research needs.
